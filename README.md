# Dataset: osm2rdf-denmark (development version)

The dataset is based on datasets that were derived from OpenStreetMap data using the osm2rdf tool. It includes information about each element which is of type node (osm:node), way (osm:way) or relation (osm:relation). Nodes are a core concept in OSM and they represent a single point in space defined by geographic coordinates. A node itself can describe for example a city, town, road junction, post box etc. A way is line, represents linear features on the ground - like a road. It consist of an ordered node list. A relation is a colection of the three core elements: nodes, ways and relations. Each element contains all atributes associated with it. The elements were shuffled to ensure that, regardless of the size of the selected subset, the proportions of different types of elements are preserved

*This README is a snapshot of documentation for the latest development version of the dataset.
Full documentation for all versions can be found [on the website](https://w3id.org/riverbench/datasets/osm2rdf-denmark/dev).*

    - **Type**: <abbr title="Class for instances of using an RDF stream type, in a program, an academic paper, or elsewhere. This class is suitable for annotating both theoretical uses and practical ones, i.e., real streams or datasets.  Instances of this class should have the stax:hasStreamType property pointing to a concrete stream type. The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.
